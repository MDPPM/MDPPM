Molecular Dynamics Phenotype Prediction Model 

This new method successfully predicts the specific disease caused by a gene variant and ranks its severity with more accuracy than existing methods.

This repository contains the code for the initial CaM simulations and analysis separated by energy parameters, the .conf files for NAMD used for all simulations, and the code for the REMD simulations for both AÎ² and CaM.
