This is the data and code,in R Sweave, for the replica exchange simulations as well as figure 7. Please download the .RData files into your working directory then execute the code in the .RNW file. Please note that because GitHub has size limitations we had to upload a random sample of our dataframes so some data will not be exactly the same as the paper. If you would like the full dataframes please email the authors.
